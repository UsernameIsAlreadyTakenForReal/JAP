# Joint Agoraphobia Project. Created for Unreal Engine 4.24

This was a summer project of me and my dear friend @IsTheUsernameReallyTaken. Budget was absolute 0 and time was short. Can be seen in the quality of the videos taken by this borrowed camera, the quality of the 360 video stitching and in us being always close by so that we don't have our camera stolen.

## If you want to take a look...
... then you should know that it's a messy project with so many possible ways to improve it.

1. Simply clone Repo;   
2. Add the following packs BY MARKETPLACE (all are free)(without any extra settings) and, if not ignored by default, add their folders to your .gitignore:
   1. FreeFurniturePack;
   2. GoodSky;
   3. Isometric - Interiors;
   4. ModularBuildingSet;
   5. StarterContent;
   6. temperate Vegetation: Spruce Forest (1.4GB);
   7. Vehicle Variety Pack.
3. Pray. Everything should be wired up;
4. Make sure that Game Instance is set to AgoraphobiaGameInstance in Edit -> Project Settings.
