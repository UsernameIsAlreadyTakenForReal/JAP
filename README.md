# Joint Agoraphobia Project. Created for Unreal Engine 4.24

This was a summer project of me and my dear friend https://github.com/IsTheUsernameReallyTaken. Aims at using VR to lower the effect of triggering factors in agoraphobia patients by exposing said patients to the outside world. Step by step, from the inside of the player's 'house' to out there in the street. The 'apartment' and the menu screen are 3D environments, while the rest of the project consists of 360° videos of some streets in Bucharest. The patient/player can fill a 'panic-gauge' that will take them back to the safety of their apartment.

Budget was absolute 0 and time was short. Can be seen in the quality of the videos taken by this borrowed camera we used, the quality of the 360° video stitching and in us being always close by so that we don't have our camera stolen.

## If you want to take a look...
... then you should know that it's a messy project with so many possible ways to improve it.

1. Install Unreal Engine 4.24 or newer;
2. Clone Repo;   
3. Add the following packs BY MARKETPLACE without any extra settings (all are free). They are blacklisted in .gitignore as to not make the repo bigger than it is:
   1. FreeFurniturePack;
   2. GoodSky;
   3. Isometric - Interiors;
   4. ModularBuildingSet;
   5. StarterContent;
   6. temperate Vegetation: Spruce Forest (1.4GB);
   7. Vehicle Variety Pack.
4. Pray. Everything should be wired up inside;
5. Make sure that Game Instance is set to AgoraphobiaGameInstance in Edit -> Project Settings;
6. Optionally, have a VR headset compatible with Unreal Engine (Oculus, HTC Vive etc).
